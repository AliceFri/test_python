# You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays nums and removeQueries, both of 
# length n. For the i·µó ∞ query, the element in nums at the index removeQueries[i] is 
# removed, splitting nums into different segments. 
# 
#  A segment is a contiguous sequence of positive integers in nums. A segment 
# sum is the sum of every element in a segment. 
# 
#  Return an integer array answer, of length n, where answer[i] is the maximum 
# segment sum after applying the i·µó ∞ removal. 
# 
#  Note: The same index will not be removed more than once. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: nums = [1,2,5,6,1], removeQueries = [0,3,2,4,1]
# Output: [14,7,2,2,0]
# Explanation: Using 0 to indicate a removed element, the answer is as follows:
# Query 1: Remove the 0th element, nums becomes [0,2,5,6,1] and the maximum 
# segment sum is 14 for segment [2,5,6,1].
# Query 2: Remove the 3rd element, nums becomes [0,2,5,0,1] and the maximum 
# segment sum is 7 for segment [2,5].
# Query 3: Remove the 2nd element, nums becomes [0,2,0,0,1] and the maximum 
# segment sum is 2 for segment [2]. 
# Query 4: Remove the 4th element, nums becomes [0,2,0,0,0] and the maximum 
# segment sum is 2 for segment [2]. 
# Query 5: Remove the 1st element, nums becomes [0,0,0,0,0] and the maximum 
# segment sum is 0, since there are no segments.
# Finally, we return [14,7,2,2,0]. 
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: nums = [3,2,11,1], removeQueries = [3,2,1,0]
# Output: [16,5,3,0]
# Explanation: Using 0 to indicate a removed element, the answer is as follows:
# Query 1: Remove the 3rd element, nums becomes [3,2,11,0] and the maximum 
# segment sum is 16 for segment [3,2,11].
# Query 2: Remove the 2nd element, nums becomes [3,2,0,0] and the maximum 
# segment sum is 5 for segment [3,2].
# Query 3: Remove the 1st element, nums becomes [3,0,0,0] and the maximum 
# segment sum is 3 for segment [3].
# Query 4: Remove the 0th element, nums becomes [0,0,0,0] and the maximum 
# segment sum is 0, since there are no segments.
# Finally, we return [16,5,3,0].
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  n == nums.length == removeQueries.length 
#  1 <= n <= 10‚Åµ 
#  1 <= nums[i] <= 10‚Åπ 
#  0 <= removeQueries[i] < n 
#  All the values of removeQueries are unique.
