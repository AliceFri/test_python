# You are given a positive integer n representing the number of nodes in an 
# undirected graph. The nodes are labeled from 1 to n. 
# 
#  You are also given a 2D integer array edges, where edges[i] = [ai, bi] 
# indicates that there is a bidirectional edge between nodes ai and bi. Notice that the 
# given graph may be disconnected. 
# 
#  Divide the nodes of the graph into m groups (1-indexed) such that: 
# 
#  
#  Each node in the graph belongs to exactly one group. 
#  For every pair of nodes in the graph that are connected by an edge [ai, bi], 
# if ai belongs to the group with index x, and bi belongs to the group with index 
# y, then |y - x| = 1. 
#  
# 
#  Return the maximum number of groups (i.e., maximum m) into which you can 
# divide the nodes. Return -1 if it is impossible to group the nodes with the given 
# conditions. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: n = 6, edges = [[1,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,6],[2,3],[4,6]]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: As shown in the image we:
# - Add node 5 to the first group.
# - Add node 1 to the second group.
# - Add nodes 2 and 4 to the third group.
# - Add nodes 3 and 6 to the fourth group.
# We can see that every edge is satisfied.
# It can be shown that that if we create a fifth group and move any node from 
# the third or fourth group to it, at least on of the edges will not be satisfied.
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: n = 3, edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1]]
# Output: -1
# Explanation: If we add node 1 to the first group, node 2 to the second group, 
# and node 3 to the third group to satisfy the first two edges, we can see that 
# the third edge will not be satisfied.
# It can be shown that no grouping is possible.
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  1 <= n <= 500 
#  1 <= edges.length <= 10‚Å¥ 
#  edges[i].length == 2 
#  1 <= ai, bi <= n 
#  ai != bi 
#  There is at most one edge between any pair of vertices.
