# You are given an undirected weighted connected graph containing n nodes 
# labeled from 0 to n - 1, and an integer array edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi, wi] 
# indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi with weight wi. 
# 
#  Some edges have a weight of -1 (wi = -1), while others have a positive 
# weight (wi > 0). 
# 
#  Your task is to modify all edges with a weight of -1 by assigning them 
# positive integer values in the range [1, 2 * 10‚Åπ] so that the shortest distance 
# between the nodes source and destination becomes equal to an integer target. If there 
# are multiple modifications that make the shortest distance between source and 
# destination equal to target, any of them will be considered correct. 
# 
#  Return an array containing all edges (even unmodified ones) in any order if 
# it is possible to make the shortest distance from source to destination equal to 
# target, or an empty array if it's impossible. 
# 
#  Note: You are not allowed to modify the weights of edges with initial 
# positive weights. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# 
#  
# Input: n = 5, edges = [[4,1,-1],[2,0,-1],[0,3,-1],[4,3,-1]], source = 0, 
# destination = 1, target = 5
# Output: [[4,1,1],[2,0,1],[0,3,3],[4,3,1]]
# Explanation: The graph above shows a possible modification to the edges, 
# making the distance from 0 to 1 equal to 5.
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# 
#  
# Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1,-1],[0,2,5]], source = 0, destination = 2, target 
# = 6
# Output: []
# Explanation: The graph above contains the initial edges. It is not possible 
# to make the distance from 0 to 2 equal to 6 by modifying the edge with weight -1. 
# So, an empty array is returned.
#  
# 
#  Example 3: 
# 
#  
# 
#  
# Input: n = 4, edges = [[1,0,4],[1,2,3],[2,3,5],[0,3,-1]], source = 0, 
# destination = 2, target = 6
# Output: [[1,0,4],[1,2,3],[2,3,5],[0,3,1]]
# Explanation: The graph above shows a modified graph having the shortest 
# distance from 0 to 2 as 6.
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  1 <= n <= 100 
#  1 <= edges.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2 
#  edges[i].length == 3 
#  0 <= ai, bi < n 
#  wi = -1 or 1 <= wi <= 107 
#  ai != bi 
#  0 <= source, destination < n 
#  source != destination 
#  1 <= target <= 10‚Åπ 
#  The graph is connected, and there are no self-loops or repeated edges 
#
